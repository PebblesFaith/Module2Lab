So far, I have learned how to program behavior in JavaScript. This module 2 lab exercise will give me a chance to practice applying the elements, I have covered in real-world scenarios. The exercise will guide me through how to program a basic guessing game. Although, you have been able to practice with the syntax of various programming elements throughout this module 2, there are additional JavaScript codes to consider when I am building a full program or application. I would not just be thinking about syntax, but also about when to use one programming element over another, how to achieve the desired end-user functionality, how to write professional, readable code, and more.
